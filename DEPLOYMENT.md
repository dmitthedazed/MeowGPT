# 🚀 Deployment Instructions for MeowGPT

## Quick Start

Your MeowGPT project is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's what's been set up:

### ✅ What's Configured

1. **package.json** - Added homepage URL and deploy scripts
2. **gh-pages** - Installed as development dependency
3. **GitHub Actions** - Automated deployment workflow
4. **Updated .gitignore** - Proper build artifact exclusion

### 🔧 Before You Deploy

1. **Update the homepage URL** in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name"
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with your repository name.

### 🚀 Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site

3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "gh-pages" branch

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### 🌐 Access Your Site

Once deployed, your MeowGPT will be available at:
`https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: Check that the homepage URL in package.json matches your repository
